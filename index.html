                <p>Discovered by John Marshall in 1931, the idol appears to mimic certain characteristics that match the Mother Goddess belief common in many early Near East civilizations. Sculptures and figurines depicting women have been observed as part of Harappan culture and religion, as multiple female pieces were recovered from Marshall's archaeological digs These figures were not categorized correctly, according to Marshall, meaning that where they were recovered from the site is not actually clear. One of said figures is 18.7 cm tall and is currently on display at the National Museum of Pakistan, in Karachi. The fertility and motherhood aspects on display on the idols is represented by the female genitalia that is presented in an almost exaggerated style as stated by Marshall, with him inferring that such figurines are offerings to the goddess, as opposed to the typical understanding of them being idols representing the goddess's likeness.Because of the figurines being unique in terms of hairstyles, body proportions, as well as headdresses and jewelry, there are theories as to who these figurines actually represent.Shereen Ratnagar theorizes that because of their uniqueness and dispersed discovery throughout the site that they could be figurines of ordinary household women, who commissioned these pieces to be used in rituals or healing ceremonies to help aforementioned individual women.</p>

                <p> Stone Hand Axe
                    Prehistoric Stone Hand Axe - Field Museum of Natural History
                    
                    Prehistoric Stone Hand Axe
                    Stone tool societies and cultures made these prehistoric Stone Hand Axes from the prehistoric Stone Age. Archaeologists study stone tools to understand the cultural implications of tool use and manufacture. 
                    
                    Stone has been used to make a variety of different tools and weapons throughout history, including arrowheads, spear points, hand axes, and querns to grind cereals into flour.
                    
                    Hand axes were the first tools to be recognized as prehistoric. The first published representation of a hand ax was drawn for a British publication in 1800. Until that time, their origins were thought to be supernatural.
                    
                    They were called thunderstones because tradition held that they had fallen from the sky during storms or were formed inside the earth by a lightning strike and then appeared at the surface.
                    
                    They were used in some rural areas as an amulet to protect against storms.
                    
                    The oldest known stone tools were found in Ethiopia and dated to about 2.6 Million Years Ago (mya).
                    
                    The early examples of hand axes date back to 1.6 mya, and by 1.8 mya, early man was present in Europe with stone tools.</p>

                    Dancing Girl, Mohenjo-daro
                    
                    Dancing Girl, Mohenjo-Daro – Art from the Indus Valley Civilization
                    The Dancing Girl is a bronze statuette created over 4,500 years ago and is a rare and unique masterpiece. It was found in the ancient Mohenjo-Daro site in 1926.
                    
                    This statue is a cultural artifact reflecting the aesthetics of a female body as conceptualized during that historical period.
                    
                    The bronze girl was made using the lost-wax casting technique and shows the expertise of the people in making bronze works during that time.
                    
                    The statuette was named “Dancing Girl” based on an assumption of her profession. She is one of two bronze artworks found at Mohenjo-Daro that shows a more natural pose than compared to other more formal figures.
                    
                    The statuette has large eyes, a flat nose, healthy cheeks, curly hair, and a broad forehead. She is a tall figure with long legs and arms, high neck, subdued belly, and sensuously modeled.
                    
                    The girl wears some bangles and a necklace. She has 25 bracelets on her left arm and four bangles on her right arm and is holding an object in her left hand. Her long hair styled as big bun rested on her shoulder.
                    
                    Archaeologists regard the Dancing Girl as:
                    
                    “the most captivating piece of art from an Indus site.”</P>

                    <p>The painting Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci is one of the most famous and recognized paintings in history. Unarguably it is the most discussed painting because of the enigmatic smile. There have been many discussions
                         about the smile of Mona Lisa, whether she is smiling or not. The major feature of this painting is that
                          Da Vinci has painted her eyes in such a way that even when you change the angle of the view, the eyes
                           of Mona Lisa seems to always follow you. The painting is done in oil on wood and is presently under
                            the ownership of the Government of France. Mona Lisa is exhibited in Louvre, Paris and it belongs
                             to the public, which means that it cannot be bought or sold.</p>

                    <P>
                        Considered to be the best artwork by Leonardo Da Vinci in 1498, the Last Supper is an important painting of the Renaissance period.
                         The image shows Jesus with his disciples for his last supper. The painting is noted for its clever use
                          of color, light, and anatomy. The painting is also a subject of many discussions and conjectures.
                           Many have proposed that the disciple sitting to the right of Jesus is Mary Magdalene and many
                            have also wondered the significance or meaning of the V shape between Jesus and the person
                             on the right. Despite all the conjectures, the Last Supper is one of the masterpieces by
                              Leonardo Da Vinci.</P>

                    <p>Painted in the year 1306 by Giotto di Bondone, this painting depicts the
                         moment of betrayal of Jesus by Judas Iscariot who identifies Jesus to the 
                         Roman soldiers by kissing him. The Scrovegni Chapel is home to the fresco cycle
                          by Giotto di Bondone, and the Kiss of Judas is the most famous painting in the cycle. 
                          Many critics believe that Giotto is a genius and no artist has been able to surpass
                           his work. His mastery is evident in the way he captured the expression of Jesus and
                            Judas at that scene of betrayal.</p>

                        <p>The Wright brothers inaugurated the aerial age with the world's first successful flights of a powered 
                            heavier-than-air flying machine. The Wright Flyer was the product of a sophisticated four-year
                             program of research and development conducted by Wilbur and Orville Wright beginning in 1899.
                              After building and testing three full-sized gliders, the Wrights' first powered airplane flew 
                              at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, making a 12-second flight,
                               traveling 36 m (120 ft), with Orville piloting. The best flight of the day,

                            launched from Cape Kennedy atop a Saturn V rocket. This Command Module, no. 107,
                             manufactured by North American Rockwell, was one of three parts of the complete
                              Apollo spacecraft. The other two parts were the Service Module and the Lunar Module,
                               nicknamed "Eagle." The Service Module contained the main spacecraft propulsion
                                system and consumables while the Lunar Module was the two-person craft used 
                                by Armstrong and Aldrin to descend to the Moon's surface on July 20.

                        <p> The mortuary temple of Hatshepsut (Egyptian: Ḏsr-ḏsrw meaning "Holy of Holies") is a mortuary temple built during the reign of Pharaoh Hatshepsut of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.[b] Located opposite the city of Luxor, it is considered to be a masterpiece of ancient architecture.[c] Its three massive terraces rise above the desert floor and into the cliffs of Deir el-Bahari. Her tomb, KV20, lies inside the same massif capped by El Qurn, a pyramid for her mortuary complex. At the edge of the desert, 1 km (0.62 mi) east, connected to the complex by a causeway lies the <br />  accompanying valley temple. Across the river Nile, the whole structure points towards the monumental Eighth Pylon, Hatshepsut's most recognizable addition to the Temple of Karnak and the site from which the procession of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley departed. The temple's twin functions are identified by its axes: its main east-west axis served to receive the barque of Amun-Re at the climax of the festival, while its north-south axis represented the life cycle of the pharaoh from coronation to rebirth.</p>
